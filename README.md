This repository contains descriptions, notebooks, coding exercises, from online courses and experiments taken on my free time. The code on the notebooks contains comments to make it easier to understand the logic and steps behind the experiments. Not all activities were uploaded, since some didn't were more teorethical or with more simple coding. 

At the present, there are still courses being attended, so this repository will still be updated
